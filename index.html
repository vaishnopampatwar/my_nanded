            Nanded, also spelled Nander, city, eastern Maharashtra state, western India. It lies in an upland region on
            the banks of the Godavari River.

            The city’s name is derived from Nanda tat (“Nanda border”), a term that refers to the boundary of the
            Magadha kingdom during the 7th century BCE. Nanded was the birthplace of three Maratha
            poet-saints—Vishnupant Shesa, Raghunath Shesa, and Vaman Pandit. The city is known as a centre of Sanskrit
            learning. A Sikh gurdwara (“temple and kitchen”) is built on the site where the Guru Gobind Singh was
            assassinated in 1708.

            Primarily a commercial centre, Nanded also has cotton spinning and weaving mills. It is home to Swami
            Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (1994), which has numerous affiliated colleges in the city and in
            other communities in the state. Nanded is situated in one of the less-developed areas of Maharashtra. Most
            of the population in the area depends on agriculture; sorghum (jowar) and rice are the major food crops, and
            cotton is the basic cash crop. Cattle breeding is also important. Major industries are those processing
            cotton, oilseeds, and sugar. Pop. (2001) city, 430,733; (2011) city, 550,439.
            A beguiling mix of ancient and modern, Nanded is one of the oldest and historic cities
            that came under the rule of various dynasties such as the Satvahanas, Chalukyas,
            Rashtrakutas, Kakatiyas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Adilshahis and finally the Mughals.
            Situated on the banks of River Godavari, it is famous today for its undisputed highlight,
            the establishment of GurudwaraHazur Sahib, where Guru Gobind Singh Ji – the tenth Guru of the Sikhs,
            breathed his last, devoting his entire life to the service of mankind. The city also houses various Sufi
            shrines,
            a beautiful waterfall of Sahastrakud and the Kandhar Fort. A huge statue of Kshetrapala is located here.
            Now in a broken condition, the statue was estimated to be taller than 50 feet.
            The Chalukya era Hottal temple near Deglur is also worth a visit.

            <h2>MAJOR ATTRACTIONS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>SAHASTRAKUND<br>It is an excellent waterfall on the Penganga River, a tributary of the Godavari
                    River at Murli village. The rock pattern in the surroundings of the falls is fascinating, as the
                    black rock gives a metal like an effect. There is a bridge across the river a little further away
                    from the falls (1 km). Sometimes the road to the bridge becomes inaccessible for four-wheelers, but
                    it can be walked down (20 mins one way). Visited throughout the year, the waterfalls make an amazing
                    tourist spot.

                </li>
                <li>SACHKHAND SRI HAZUR SAHIB<br>According to Sikh history, it’s from here that the tenth Guru, Guru
                    Gobind Singh Ji, left for his heavenly abode. A Gurudwara was built here in 1837 by the great Sikh
                    ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Today, Hazur Sahib stands as a soul to the city of Nanded. The
                    Gurudwara is considered to be one of the holiest of the five “Takhts“ or the seat of authority in
                    the Sikh religion. An architectural beauty, the sprawling temple area is made of white marble, with
                    decorated floors and a dome adorned with gold. Other important Gurudwaras situated in and around
                    Nanded are Bandaghat Langar Sahib, Mata Sahib Dewa, Maltekri Sahib, Naginaghat Nanak Puri, Shikar
                    Ghat Gurudwaras and Sangat Sahib.<br>

                </li>
                <li>NANDED FORT<br>A place set aloof, away from the city hustle-bustle, Nanded Fort, in the state
                    Maharashtra, is one of the most popular tourist attractions. The fort, now in ruins, is bordered by
                    Godavari River and offers an impressive picturesque view of the area. There are plenty of vast
                    agricultural lands near the fort, lending an untouched look to it. There are ample lodging spaces
                    available nearby, clean and decently priced. What makes the enormous beauty of the place even more
                    delightful is the wonderful hospitality of people living here. Nanded Fort is a total delight for
                    history buffs, architecture enthusiasts, and photography fanatics.
